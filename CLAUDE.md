# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new project directory that hasn't been initialized yet. Based on the directory name `vikram-bmad-hyd-eco-primeng`, this may be intended as a PrimeNG-based Angular project for an ecological/environmental application in Hyderabad.

## Getting Started

Since this is an empty project directory, you'll likely need to:

1. Initialize the project structure (Angular CLI, npm init, etc.)
2. Set up the development environment
3. Configure build tools and dependencies

## Development Commands

*Commands will be added once package.json and project structure are established*

## Architecture Notes

*Architecture documentation will be added as the project structure develops*

1) use only prime-ng components
2) use only tailwind css
3) don't write css unnessarily

## Additional Notes

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the project is initialized with:
- Package.json scripts for build, test, lint commands
- Project architecture and folder structure
- Development workflow guidelines
- Any specific PrimeNG or Angular patterns used in the project
